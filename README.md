# project-2-crypto-Watchlist

Welcome to my project "Crypto Watchlist!"

Step 1: Go to https://github.com/xiaochenx/project-2-crypto-wallet and clone repo to your local directory.

Step 2: Cd into <crypto-wallet> folder and run "npm start" to open the app in your browser.

Step 3: Open another tab in CLI and run " json-server --watch db.json --port 3001" to start json server.

Step 4: Click "Market" tab to render a list of available crypto currencies on the market, which fetches from an internal db.json file.

    With each crypto comes an "Add" and a "Permenantly Delete" button. "Add" will add the crypto of your choice to the tab "My Watchlist".

"Permenantly Delete" button will delete that crypto from the backend database permenantly.

Step 5: Under "My Watchlist", there will be a list of cryptos added by you previously under the "Market" tab.

    Along with each crypto there is a delete button, this only deletes that crypto from the page, but the crypto is still in the backend database.

Hope you enjoy exploring my React App! Thank you for your time!
